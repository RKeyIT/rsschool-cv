## _Bio_

*Hi there!* My name is Roman Krytski. Yes! R **o** man. That's so funny story. Prepare yourself!
\
I was borned Russia. In this country and this language we can meet only "Roman" name. Buuut... If you will re-locate yourself in Belarus and gots Belarus citizenship (or nationality) you will change this name on "rAman" if you didn't nothing with that. Of Course you will not. You know why? Because you didn't know belarus language rules! \:\)
\
Because in belarus language we cant to say Roman with akcent on **a**, because in language rules we have point like this: _If we have letter **o** into word, akcent into word will be on this letter **O**_. Exactly it means that my name (read with akcent on 'a') Roman akcent will changed on letter **o**...

So that was trouble for administration of my country and i've been know about my new name only when got's my pasport.

And now (already in Poland) my name is 'Raman' (with latin letters), before Poland my name was 'Раман'.

**Pleased to meet you \:\)**
